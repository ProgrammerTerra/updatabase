# updatabase

For years, I have been tracking my film, tv, reading, and gaming habits through excel. I started using excel thinking that some day I would find something better, but whether it was Goodreads, Letterboxd, or some niche website, I never found a tracker that I was satisfied with. So I've decided to build my own.

This product is still very much in development but  if you've also found content trackers to be lackluster try updatabase out and see if it fits your needs better than what you're currently using. I will be making the perfect app for my own sensibilities, with the hope that others may have the same desires I've had for years. 

# why a desktop app? 

After the years of ruminating on this idea I have a specific product in my head that fits specifically into my workflow. One piece of that is having this app be a desktop app rather than a website. For me, any tracker should have as few barriers to use as possible to get to your data. You should be able to be in any app and quickly reference something in your tracker, without needing to open up your browser, go to the website, and then navigate it. A desktop app has the least amount of friction between the user and the data they're trying to find. For that reason (among others) I am building updatabase in Tauri, a cutting-edge software framework that uses Rust as its backend.
